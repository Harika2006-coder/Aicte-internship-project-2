# Water Quality Prediction - RMS

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

# Overview

Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

# In this project, we:

Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasetsUsed supervised machine learning for multi-target regressionBuilt a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressorEvaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics

# Technologies Used

Python 3.12Pandas, NumPy – Data handlingScikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluationMatplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualizationJupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation

# Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

NH4BOD5 (BSK5)ColloidsO2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 andCL

# Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

R² ScoreMean Squared Error (MSE)

Performance was acceptable across all parameters
